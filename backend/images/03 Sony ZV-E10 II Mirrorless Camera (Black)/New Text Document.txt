Overview
With improved features that expand upon its content-creation-focused predecessor, the Sony ZV-E10 II is outfitted with a 26MP APS-C sensor for faster performance and high-quality imagery in a compact form factor designed for vloggers. This aligns the ZV-E10 II with tried and true models such as the FX30 and the a6700. Built-in creative shooting modes, a 3-capsule directional microphone, and a 3" articulating LCD touchscreen with vertical orientation support and integrated tally light make for a powerful multi-purpose vlogging device. Other notable upgrades with the ZV-E10 II include a 759-point phase detection autofocus system, Cinematic Vlog mode, and compatibility with larger-capacity NP-FZ100 batteries.
